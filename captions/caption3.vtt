00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:02.700
In Unit 3 of this course

00:00:02.701 --> 00:00:07.100
you will learn about implementing
Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS,

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.233
to beautify the code you created
in the previous unit.

00:00:11.233 --> 00:00:14.933
Separating the content and structure
from the presentation

00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:20.666
allows you to make aesthetic changes to your pages
without having to wade through miles of code.

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:27.332
In fact, the process of changing a site's
appearance using CSS can be downright simple.

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:33.266
In this unit, you’ll learn to use CSS
to change the color...

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:38.166
And how to change the typography,
or how the text is presented on the web pages...

00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:42.166
including font family...

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.099
font size...

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.000
line height...

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.500
and character spacing...

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.966
to name only a few of the many possibilities.

00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:56.996
When you apply a new style to an HTML element

00:00:56.997 --> 00:01:02.232
that change will affect each instance
of that HTML element in your web page.

00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:08.033
But what if you only want to change one instance
of an HTML element?

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:14.599
You can do that by adding an id attribute
to that element in your HTML code...

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:22.200
then in your CSS, add a style definition
specifically for that id...

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.900
And if you want to change several instances of a
particular HTML element, but not all of them,

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:35.700
you do that by adding a class attribute
to each of the HTML elements you want to change.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:43.000
Then in your CSS, add a style definition
specifically for that class...

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.700
You will also learn how to use pseudo-class
selectors to add unique styles to elements

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.200
under certain circumstances, such as when a
mouse user is hovering over that element...

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.033
Or when a keyboard user is focused on an
element by tabbing onto it.

00:02:03.033 --> 00:02:09.966
And finally, you will learn to use CSS to control
layout and position of elements on your page.

00:02:09.966 --> 00:02:15.366
For example, remember the navigation menu you
added to your portfolio in Unit 2?

00:02:15.366 --> 00:02:19.632
Well, that didn't look much like a navigation menu,
did it?

00:02:19.633 --> 00:02:25.066
It looked like an unordered list of links,
which is of course exactly what it is.

00:02:25.066 --> 00:02:31.166
With CSS you can turn off the bullets
on your list items...

00:02:31.166 --> 00:02:35.499
Float the list items beside each other horizontally...

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.666
Add a right margin to each list item
to create some separation...

00:02:40.666 --> 00:02:43.000
And lots more.

00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:49.632
The fun thing about CSS is it never hurts to try
a variety of properties and see what effect they have.

00:02:49.633 --> 00:02:53.233
If you don't like the effect, try something else.

00:02:53.233 --> 00:02:56.466
Take a look at this page.

00:02:56.466 --> 00:03:03.499
By simply selecting a new style sheet, notice how
it looks like an entirely different web site now,

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.300
when in fact the HTML content wasn’t altered
in any way.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:15.200
The only thing that changed is the appearance,
and that was done entirely with CSS.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.633
The more you play with CSS, the more you'll
come to appreciate that stylesheets can have a

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:25.366
profound impact on the way your website looks
and feels.
