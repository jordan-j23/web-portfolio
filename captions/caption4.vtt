00:00:00.075 --> 00:00:02.933
In Unit 4 of this course

00:00:02.934 --> 00:00:06.933
you will learn about adding photos
and other graphics to your web pages.

00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:12.299
In order to work with graphics you're going to need
some sort of image editing program.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.200
These come in all sizes and learning curves,
and range from free to hundreds of dollars.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.166
For the purposes of this demonstration,
I'll be using Adobe Photoshop.

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:27.999
You may need to consult the documentation
of your particular application

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.666
in order to perform some of the commands
I'll be showing you.

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.000
In the first part of this unit

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:39.432
we'll begin with a general introduction to web graphics
and their effective use.

00:00:39.433 --> 00:00:44.433
Graphics should fit with the purpose,
organization, and style of the page...

00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:46.399
should load quickly...

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.399
and should complement the content of the page,
not interfere with it.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.566
We'll also address copyright concerns
for the images obtained from other sources.

00:00:56.566 --> 00:01:00.000
There is a distinct set of ground rules
you'll need to keep in mind,

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:05.432
but when in doubt,
always get permission from the copyright holder.

00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:10.000
In the second module of this unit
you'll learn the basics of digital imagery

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:15.000
and the special roles that an image's
resolution, dimensions, and file format play

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:19.400
in determining its quality and file size.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.266
These qualities are of particular interest
to any web designer.

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:26.466
By choosing the right format for the image type

00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:30.000
and by keeping the resolution
and dimensions to a reasonable size,

00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:33.599
you can help ensure that your web page,
including any graphics it contains,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.199
loads quickly and doesn't force users to wait.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.000
'cause nobody likes to wait.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.166

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:44.599
Images for your web projects can come from anywhere...

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:46.599
stock image databases,
your own digital photography,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.033
or even printed material
(with the help of a scanner).

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:56.833
You'll soon discover how to acquire these graphics
as well as how to crop and resize them.

00:01:56.833 --> 00:02:03.433
Cropping an image entails cutting out portions of it
to fundamentally change the composition of the image.

00:02:03.433 --> 00:02:07.699
Resizing an image keeps all information in the image,

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:11.699
but shrinks it down so that
the graphic fits better within your web page.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.500
You'll end up making judicious use of both techniques,
and many more, in this unit.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.266
By the end of this unit,
you will have created a photo album ...

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:26.499
Clickable buttons for your portfolio home page...

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.566
A favicon, that small icon that appears in the browser tab
for your web page, among other places...

00:02:32.566 --> 00:02:35.132


00:02:35.133 --> 00:02:39.133
And an eye-catching banner that will appear
across the top of your website.

00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:41.233

00:02:41.233 --> 00:02:44.433
As you learn how to create all these images...

00:02:44.433 --> 00:02:48.433
you'll also learn the HTML code
for adding them to your web page

00:02:48.433 --> 00:02:52.333
including techniques for ensuring the images
are accessible to people who can't see them.

00:02:52.333 --> 00:02:54.399

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.533
You can also add images to web pages using CSS,
and you'll learn about that too.

00:03:00.533 --> 00:03:07.166
This is an especially useful technique for adding images
that are purely decorative, such as background images.
