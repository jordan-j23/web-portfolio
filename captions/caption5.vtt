00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In Unit 5 of this course

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.633
you'll learn how web developers use scripting
to make their websites more interactive.

00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:15.033
On today's web, you can shop online...

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:16.633
Bank online...

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:17.899
Watch videos...

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.733
Listen to music...

00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.733
Share photos...

00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.833
Chat with friends...

00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:26.466
Play interactive games...

00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.932
Contribute to the world's collective knowledge...

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:31.633
...and on and on.

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:34.000
The level of interactivity on today's web

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.466
would not be possible if we were
limited to using HTML and CSS.

00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:43.332
So, we reply on scripts.

00:00:43.332 --> 00:00:48.332
Scripts are computer programs that are written
in a variety of different scripting languages.

00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:54.899
There are two general types of scripts
for the web, server-side and client-side.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.933
Server-side scripts are executed on the server,
before the web page is delivered to the user.

00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:05.433
This allows web pages to be custom built
with every request.

00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:10.000
In the first module of this unit you will learn
about a variety of server-side technologies

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that are working hard
behind the scenes

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.566
to assemble and deliver a web page to you
whenever you enter a web address into your browser.

00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:26.599
In contrast, client-side scripts are executed in the
browser, after the web page is already delivered.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.366
The most common client-side scripting language
is JavaScript,

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:35.366
and for most of this unit you will be
learning the basics of writing JavaScript code.

00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:37.399


00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.100
Your first scripting activity will be to display a
simple alert that appears automatically when the
page is loaded.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.766


00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:49.032
But you probably don't want an alert to pop up
every time a user loads a page.

00:01:49.032 --> 00:01:51.032
That would be annoying.

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:55.766
So you'll learn how to show the alert only when a
user performs some action,

00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:58.000
for example, clicking on a button.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.133
From there, you'll continue to expand your knowledge
of JavaScript by building a digital clock.

00:02:03.133 --> 00:02:04.499

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.166
This activity involves all the skills you've learned
so far in this course, starting with HTML.

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:13.332
Even though you'll be building the clock
using JavaScript,

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:17.332
the clock is actually just hours and
minutes, separated by a colon.

00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:19.333
It's just HTML – nothing fancy.

00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:20.999


00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.300
If you want it to look like a clock,
you can do that with CSS.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:34.800
For example... We  want our clock
to have large easy-to-read numbers.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.333
So we'll increase font size
and make the type bold as well.

00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:42.266


00:02:42.266 --> 00:02:46.266
Of course, a clock isn't really a clock
unless it keeps accurate time.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.666
This is where JavaScript comes in.

00:02:48.666 --> 00:02:53.566
The activities in this unit will provide you with
all the code you need to update the time...

00:02:53.566 --> 00:02:55.966


00:02:55.966 --> 00:03:01.332
Add leading zeros if hours or minutes
are less than 10; plus add "am" or "pm"...

00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:03.666


00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:06.699
And continually update the time every second.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.500


00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:20.166
You'll also learn to use JavaScript to show...
and hide... content on the page.

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:25.832
In the end, you'll have a fully functional
 – and very cool – digital clock.

00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:27.733
But more importantly...

00:03:27.733 --> 00:03:33.733
you'll have gained some valuable experience
using JavaScript in conjunction with HTML and CSS.
