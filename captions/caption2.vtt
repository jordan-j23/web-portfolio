00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:02.399
In Unit 2 of this course

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:08.399
you will learn the basic elements of
creating a simple web page using HTML.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.266
This unit is all about the content and structure
of your web pages.

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:19.266
It's tempting to think about how you want your
web page to look, but that comes later.

00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:23.199
In the next unit you will learn about
how to make your content look good.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.366
But first, you need to create the content.

00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:32.199
Prior to doing any actual coding,
you’ll need to consider the site's purpose.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.066
Is it to sell?

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.699
To inform?

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.233
To entertain?

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:44.266
With the site's purpose and target audience in mind,
you can plan out the site.

00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:47.766
In this course you'll be creating a portfolio site,

00:00:47.767 --> 00:00:51.766
and the overall structure of that site
is essentially planned out for you.

00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:55.666
But you'll have an opportunity to do
a pre-planning exercise

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:58.666
to at least get you thinking
about the process.

00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:01.599
Finally, it will be time to code.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.666
The primary language that web pages are written in
is HTML.

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:11.221
In Unit 1 you learned that HTML has been around
since the early 1990's

00:01:11.222 --> 00:01:14.966
and there are several versions of this language.

00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:20.799
In this course you'll be using the latest version,
HTML5.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.033
No special software is necessary.

00:01:24.034 --> 00:01:29.032
All you really need to start creating web pages right now
is a simple text editor...

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:31.099
a web browser...

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.166
and a bit of coding know-how.

00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:38.366
In HTML5, the only tags that are required

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:44.365
are the doctype tag, which tells the browser
which version of HTML you're using...

00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:50.266
And the title tag, which shows up in the title bar
of the browser window.

00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:57.299
Of course, if you only used these two tags, you
wouldn't have a very interesting web page.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.066
In this unit you will learn a variety of
other tags as well, including...

00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:03.599
Headings...

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.533
Subheadings...

00:02:05.533 --> 00:02:07.633
Paragraphs...

00:02:07.633 --> 00:02:10.333
Ordered lists...

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:14.566
And unordered lists...

00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:19.132
A common example of a list that appears on most
web pages is a navigation menu,

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:25.499
which is essentially a list of the web pages
that comprise the site.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.733
You'll use HTML list tags to create
a navigation menu for your portfolio site.

00:02:31.733 --> 00:02:36.001
Of course, since this unit is about content,
not presentation,

00:02:36.002 --> 00:02:40.000
it won't look like the navigation menus
you're accustomed to.

00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:43.600
But again, that will come later.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.133
You'll also learn how to add links to web pages.

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:55.966
For example, a navigation menu isn't just a list of
web pages – it's a list of links to web pages.

00:02:55.966 --> 00:02:59.366
You’ll also learn how to add tables to your site.

00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:05.299
Tables are great for showing relationships
between data using rows and columns.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.000
All of the tags we've talked about so far

00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:13.800
have been around for a long time,
in some cases since the very first version of HTML.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.800
You'll also have an opportunity to explore some of
the brand new tags that are introduced in HTML5

00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:22.100
including semantic tags like...

00:03:23.733 --> 00:03:25.999


00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.366
and many more, each of which marks up a
specific region of the web page.

00:03:32.366 --> 00:03:35.566
Another exciting new feature in HTML5

00:03:35.567 --> 00:03:40.566
is that you can now add audio or video
to your web pages with very little code.

00:03:40.566 --> 00:03:47.699
In fact, you might even be watching this video
in an HTML5 video format.
