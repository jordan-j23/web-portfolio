00:00:00.063 --> 00:00:02.000
In Unit 7 of this course

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:05.800
you will be exploring the wide variety
of tools that are available

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.800
to help people publish content on the web.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.000
Throughout this course, you have learned
to create websites by writing code,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.233
including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:20.933
Being able to understand websites at a
code level is a valuable skill for anyone,

00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:27.633
but is especially essential if you might be doing
web design or development as part of your future career.

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:31.000
Virtually every organization
uses the web to do its work

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.666
so knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:38.899
are highly desirable and
marketable skills for many jobs.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.366
Although it's important to understand
the code behind the scenes, let's face it.

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:47.232
Developing all your web pages by hand
can be pretty time consuming.

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:51.000
This is why there are a variety
of web authoring tools available,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.466
such as Kompozer and Adobe Dreamweaver.

00:00:54.466 --> 00:01:00.000
Web authoring tools allow you to create a web page
using a familiar, easy-to-use interface,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.799
much like a word processing program.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.000
Just type in your text,
select a few options from the menu or toolbar,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.066
and all of the code gets written for you
on the back-end.

00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:17.000
Most web authoring tools these days
create valid, standards-compliant code,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.932
but you might still want to do some editing
to the code the tool generates

00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:26.366
and most tools provide you with the ability
to switch back and forth between a visual design view...

00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:28.499
Code view...

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.366
or a split view where you can work
with both views simultaneously.

00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:37.000
All of the features of web pages
that you've been learning to code by hand

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.232
can be done through menus, buttons,
and dialog boxes with these tools.

00:01:43.233 --> 00:01:47.266
You can also get that perfect look and feel

00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:53.266
by selecting different options from a dialog box,
rather than typing in CSS code from scratch.

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:58.066
These tools also provide a rich variety of
other features for managing websites,

00:01:58.066 --> 00:02:00.000
including automatically uploading
changes to your site

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.899
as well as letting you view
the relationships between pages.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.833
Also, there are a growing number
of tools available on-line

00:02:08.833 --> 00:02:12.833
that enable novice users to create websites
simply by selecting a template

00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:16.499
and entering their content
into web-based form fields.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.933
This includes content management systems
such as Drupal, Joomla, and WordPress...

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:25.733
Blogging software such as Movable Type and Blogger...

00:02:25.733 --> 00:02:31.066
Wiki software such as MediaWiki,
the software behind Wikipediaâ€¦

00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:37.666
And other website publishing tools such as
Google Sites and Yahoo! SiteBuilder.

00:02:37.666 --> 00:02:42.666
This unit will give you an opportunity to
explore each of these tools and services,

00:02:42.666 --> 00:02:46.866
and to consider their implications
for careers in web design and development.

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:49.032
What are the implications?

00:02:49.033 --> 00:02:52.000
With all of these tools available
to help people and organizations

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.399
to create and manage websites
without knowing anything about HTML...

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.433
does that mean everything you've learned
in this course has been a waste of time?

00:03:00.433 --> 00:03:02.499
Not at all!

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.066
Each of the tools and services described in this lesson
ultimately delivers content to the browser

00:03:08.066 --> 00:03:14.432
in HTML, stylized with CSS,
with behavior added using JavaScript.

00:03:14.433 --> 00:03:19.999
As long as there's a World Wide Web, these
technologies will likely be at the heart of that Web,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.966
and there will always be a demand
for people who understand these technologies.
